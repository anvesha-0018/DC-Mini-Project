<H1>Performance Evaluation of CSMA/CD-Based V2X Communication Using NS-3 and SUMO</H1>
<p>This project simulates Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication using the CSMA/CD protocol, integrated with SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and NS-3 (Network Simulator 3). It aims to evaluate CSMA/CD performance in dynamic vehicular environments by modeling realistic traffic scenarios in SUMO and simulating message exchange in NS-3. Key performance metrics—throughput, end-to-end delay, and collision rate—are analyzed under varying traffic densities and communication loads. The results offer insights into the suitability and limitations of CSMA/CD for high-mobility V2X communication.
